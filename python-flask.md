- To properly get messages from a flask app running on gunicorn, the command needs to be as such: `gunicorn project.file:app --log-file=- --log-level debug`
- PyCharm understands gunicorn only after ["gevent compatible debugging"](http://stackoverflow.com/a/20738996/1558430) is enabled.
- The view's function `__name__` _is_ the view's name. This means a name cannot contain things like colons.
- `url_for('foo.bar')` gives you the url for a view named `bar` in a [blueprint](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/blueprints/) called `foo`.
- Views can return just a string as the response.
- [There are no nested blueprints](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33003178/nested-blueprints-in-flask) (yet)
- Flask SQLAlchemy creates only one `db.session` that you can commit at any time.
- Understand flask ["blueprints"](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/blueprints/) as traits that are common across some of your views, like templates or url prefixes.
- "Async Flask" is called [Sanic](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). They don't say it's Flask, but the APIs sure look like Flask.
