- "Let me tell you something. The climate justice movement? Not clued in enough on this. Not clued in enough on this. The climate justice movement is a movement that says, 'we're worried about our future. *What future? What future?* Children in the African continent, in Asia, in Latin America; they don't have a future; they don't have a present. *They're not worried about the future; they're worried about their present.* Your slogan is "we're worried about the future"? What future? That's a middle-class bourgeois western slogan. You got to be worried about now. 2.7 billion people can't eat now, and you're telling people, *'reduce your consumption'*? How does this sound to a child who hasn't eaten in days? You've got to clue into this, guys." - Vijay Prashard, [on the climate movement, and how the UK fucked India for 400 years straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bho6xY-jSuE)
- [BP made up the term "carbon footprint"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint) to make it sound like individual responsibility, not [responsiblity of the largest polluters in the world](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/09/revealed-20-firms-third-carbon-emissions), among which is BP.
- Similarly, [the recycle symbol on plastic does not mean it is recyclable](https://oceana.org/blog/recycling-myth-month-those-numbered-symbols-single-use-plastics-do-not-mean-you-can-recycle-me). Only 9% of plastic is actually recycled. Having the symbol there makes people feel better about using plastics. Who lobbied to have this happen? [Big Oil](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled).
- The [ManBearPig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuKjwWYyfkw) was created as [an allegory for Climate Change denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ManBearPig#Legacy), for which critics allege "everyone has an agenda ... they throw around bad science, ... you can't just let people tell you that if you don't believe in [ManBearPig], then you don't care about the world."
- [We are already screwed for climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHdcpxmJ6vg). The ship has sailed.
- [Recycling doesn't work](https://thewalrus.ca/why-recycling-doesnt-work/). The New York times has published [one](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/30/magazine/recycling-is-garbage.html), [two](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/opinion/sunday/the-reign-of-recycling.html), [three](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/climate/recycling-landfills-plastic-papers.html), and [four](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/local-recycling-costs.html) articles about it, and I have read none of them.
- [Rwanda banned plastic bags.](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/15/rwanda-banned-plastic-bags-so-can-we) Rumour claims the environment there is great.
- Particle board is made with wood chips. IKEA makes "environmentally-friendly" single-use furniture with it.
- (Other) IKEA sustainability initiatives are mostly there as a sales tactic. [Rug made from recycled plastic bottles](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/toftlund-rug-white-20420241/) introduces microplastics into the environment by shredding that bottle into a billion tiny fibres. If they truly care about the environment, they could used [tencel modal](https://ecocult.com/greenwashing-alert-that-natural-fabric-made-from-plants-might-be-toxic/) instead.
- People going to a funeral has (on average) [3x the environmental damage](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/dissolving_the_dead) as the cremation itself.
- [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox). Increasing efficiency in anything (like cars with better fuel economy) somehow increases overall usage (like, more people driving because it's efficient). To reduce overall environmental impact, simply increasing efficiency does not work, "however, governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising".
- Indians (Hindus; Northeast) were looking for ways to dispose of bodies using the river in a way that [they won't wash back up](http://www.planetcustodian.com/2015/10/19/8134/over-50-scary-images-depicting-filth-of-varanasi-and-river-ganges-that-went-viral-in-china.html). [They are still doing it](http://www.featureshoot.com/2017/02/a-death-photographer-on-the-sacred-river-ganges/). Don't worry though, [it's not like anyone drinks out of that river or anything.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges#Pollution_and_environmental_concerns)
- For whatever reason, [lamb is even more environmentally damaging than beef to produce](http://www.wri.org/blog/2016/04/sustainable-diets-what-you-need-know-12-charts). which is awful.
- [Plastic tea bags may shed billions of microplastics per cup.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/tea-bags-plastic-study-mcgill-1.5295662)
- Waxed paper straws existed before plastic straws did.
- Fossil fuels meet [85% of the world's energy needs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3n8txX3144) (i.e. nuclear and renewable energy need to increase output by 10x to replace it), of which [coal makes up 38%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation), and, surprisingly, nuclear is *absolutely* declining by wattage.
- Brazil: [we will have zero illegal deforestation :)](https://news.mongabay.com/2021/05/zero-illegal-deforestation-one-more-bolsonaro-distortion-commentary/). What they meant was they are making deforestation legal.
