- 南杏 and 北杏 are from different plants. The southern variant is sweet and not poisonous. The northern variant is bitter, poisonous (hydrogen cyanide), and can kill you in large quantities. But the cyanide content also soothes the throat if taken in moderation. Both of them are in fact [apricot kernels](https://medicalinspire.com/web/posts/31442/%E3%80%90%E9%A3%9F%E6%9D%90%E7%AD%86%E8%A8%98%E3%80%91%E5%8D%97%E6%9D%8F%E5%8C%97%E6%9D%8F%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%88%86%E8%BE%A8%EF%BC%9F%E5%B0%8F%E5%BF%83%E7%94%9F%E5%8C%97%E6%9D%8F%E5%90%AB%E6%9C%89/), and have nothing to do with what we call 杏仁, or almonds.

So Allen can't be removed as legal representative unless they go to court in Shenzhen for several years to invalidate the chop. ... Or they can steal back the chop. ..." either way, you'll need the seal to do anything to the person who has possession of the seal.
- 三观不合 means you will never be compatible with somone who doesn't have the same world view, values, or attitude towards life. 古人称之为「道不同，不相为谋」，用现在的话来说，叫做「三观不合，不相为友」。 三观就是世界观、价值观、人生观，这「三观」不合的人是不太可能做朋友的，勉强不来的。

- [Eunuchs have *the whole package* cut off](https://cavemancircus.com/2020/04/15/how-does-a-eunuch-urinate/). Many of them die after surgery due to infection.

- [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau#Twin_towns_and_sister_cities), an SAR, has sister cities. Hong Kong, also an SAR, [does not](https://www.skyscrapercity.com/threads/why-isnt-hk-in-the-sister-cities-program.523464/).

- The Chinese government believes it has no issues with human rights because [its definition of human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_China#Position_of_the_government) is different from that of [the universal one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights): that welfare of the collective should be put ahead of the rights of individuals, which makes it a-ok to oppress the minority if it benefits the majority. The oppressed don't necessarily agree, of course, and in a [single-party, authoritarian system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7dTDjRnBqU), you don't really have a say anyway.

A Chinese person said the "up to 1.5 million" estimate cannot be true: "that's like locking up [an entire city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan). We don't have the space for that". The "Centers" are [quite nice inside](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/secret-footage-uighur-detention-merdan-ghappar-chinese-prison-xinjiang). No blood or filth or anything.

- The [22 states that disapprove Xinjiang re-education camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps#International_reactions) are the ones that we often consider more developed than China (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada).
