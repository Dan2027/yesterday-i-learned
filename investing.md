# What is investing?

First, understand that [inflation is an idiot tax](https://reformedperspective.ca/the-hidden-tax-of-inflation/), and the rich hold very little cash.

Then, realise investing is [shorting of a currency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HmGLV46L60), or telling the world that you have no faith in the currency, relative to other kinds of assets, especially if they generate passive income.

## Terms

- AUR: average user retention
- [Capitulation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitulation.asp): Sell at a loss. Paradoxically, if everyone capitulates, then prices can only go up, making it a buying opportunity.
- Credit Crunch: when no one wants to buy debt. The yield goes up (they are high-risk debts that have lower prices than low-risk debts).
- Debt monetisation: when the central bank prints money to buy debt.
- ROI (Return on investment): (Income - taxes) last year, divided by the debts. Higher is better.
- [Underwriters](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underwriter.asp): they determine the offering price of a stock (whether initial aka IPO or when the company is bought out), and then get some underwriting fee for doing it. That price determined affect how the rest of the market prices the remaining stock. Say if you trade at $8 but the [bought deal](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/boughtdeal.asp) offers each share at $7, then the market might adjust to \$7.
- p.s. "bought deal" means someone buys all available shares.
- [Slippage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is actually executed. However, [beta slippage](https://seekingalpha.com/article/1864191-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-decay-of-leveraged-etfs) is something else; it refers to the difference between "going down 10% and then back up by 10%", which, unfortunately, does not add up to 1.

1. If the rate is *about* to rise, [consider locking in to a lower rate](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2022/01/will-higher-mortgage-rates-derail-the-housing-market/) before the interest rate actually rises, i.e. buy now because it is too late.

## Cash

| Pros              | Cons                   |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Low volatility    | Never beats inflation  |
| High availability | No passive returns     |
|                   | Not actually investing |

## Savings account

| Pros              | Cons                   |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Low volatility    | Rarely beats inflation |
| High availability | Can *cost* money       |

Your purchasing power drops if the interest rate is below inflation (2%), which is often the case.

Fiat currency is rigged against you. The government sets a positive target inflation rate of 2% to make sure you know keeping money is not a good idea; they want you to put your money out and circulate in the economy instead.

## Bonds

| Pros               | Cons                                                                                      |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Low volatility     | [Rarely beats inflation](https://www.ft.com/content/2ae4237a-2d3e-33dd-b9e0-120c4a93a29c) |
| Has minimum return | Has maximum return (precious metals do not)                                               |
|                    | Hard to buy                                                                               |

* Bonds do not correlate to stock market performance.
* Since bonds are sold in large quantities, you typically don't buy stocks directly. Buy mutual funds or ETFs that invest in bonds instead.

* In a positive interest rate economy, bonds probably yield you however much the interest rate is. In a negative interest rate economy, [bonds earn you nothing](https://global.pimco.com/en-gbl/resources/education/investing-in-a-negative-interest-rate-world) (or worse, cost you money to invest in).
* When interest rates rise, bond yields go up, and [the older low-yield bonds drop in value relative to the new, higher-yield bonds.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/tbqd7p/attn_bond_investors/). So your bond ETFs will go down in price.
* Think of bonds as an inflation hedge (like precious metals) that have a minimum "return", but also have a maximum. In the case of hyperinflation, precious metals don't have a maximum "return".
* You can tell how screwed bonds/bond funds are by looking at the [bond yield](https://ca.investing.com/rates-bonds/canada-5-year-bond-yield), which is a number posted by some... one. When that gets close to 0%, you should sell. And when it actually hits 0% (once inflation is taken into account), it is a signal that you *must* sell.
* When "inverted yield curve" (term for short-term bonds having a higher yield than long-term bonds) happens, [be careful of a recession](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp).

## Equity ("stocks")

| Pros                        | Cons                                                         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Can have the highest return | [High volatility](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets)   |
| Often pays dividends        | Requires market and company research                         |

["Describing the U.S. stock market as zero-sum before costs, then negative-sum after costs, is a fine approximation of the truth."](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/841310/is-the-stock-market-a-zero-sum-game)

- "Don't pick stocks" - [wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/5rules) (low MER index funds are good enough for most people)
- "DON'T PICK STOCKS" - Motley Fool podcast. 40% of companies on the stock exchange end up going out of business.
- Invest in a company only if you have a good answer for "why are you investing in this particular company?"
- If you don't expect a stock to outperform an index fund---which has far less risk---don't buy the stock. Actually, if you don't expect a stock to be able to beat the market at all, don't buy any stocks. You aren't cut out for stocks.
- Never spend all your money on stocks.

### Terms

- Board Lot: a unit for "number of shares" in your stock exchange. Typically, A lot is 100 shares. Because trading 100 shares is easier than trading 17 shares, trading is often done in lots.
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence): The MACD is calculated by simply subtracting a 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) of the closing prices from a 12-period EMA. The signal line is a nine-period exponential moving average of the MACD.
- Book value: the "net asset value" of the company. A company's stock can (intrinsically) cost $5, but be traded at $300 because people love to speculate.
- Buy on Stop: buy, when the price hits the value you specified.
- Div yield (%): total dividend per year per share
- EPS: earnings per share
- p.s. "bought deal" means someone buys all available shares.
- [Slippage](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is actually executed. However, [beta slippage](https://seekingalpha.com/article/1864191-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-decay-of-leveraged-etfs) is something else; it refers to the difference between "going down 10% and then back up by 10%", which, unfortunately, does not add up to 1.
- ["Consider various strategies alternatives available to the company." means "sell, sell, sell."](http://www.fool.ca/2016/06/03/why-did-concordia-healthcare-corp-drop-over-20-yesterday/)
- A [Full Gap Up](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:trading_strategies:gap_trading_strategies#full_gap_upshort) occurs when the opening price is greater than yesterday's high price.
- A Full Gap Down occurs when the opening price is less than yesterday's low.
- A Partial Gap Up occurs when today's opening price is higher than yesterday's close, but not higher than yesterday's high.
- A Partial Gap Down occurs when the opening price is below yesterday's close, but not below yesterday's low.

### Shorting

["Shorting" stocks](http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/shorting-stocks.html) involves you borrowing your broker's stocks, buying your copy of these stocks at a lower price, and giving back these stocks to your broker. You end up with these stocks, and the price difference. [You can lose more than what you put into the market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMqZR3pqMjg). You can lose $900 on $100 worth of stocks if the price goes up 9x.

[*You don't actually know you are "borrowing" someone's stocks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLLDyoKsR8k) The broker does it behind the scenes, just like how a bank would lend out *your* money to others, because chances are the bank's customers won't be withdrawing money all at once.

Similarly, [Margins](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/11/dangerous-moves-first-time-investors.asp?no_header_alt=true) involve borrowing money to buy stocks that (you hope it will) go up. If you invest with, say, 3x the "money you never had", then the combined buying power of 4x will effectively give you the ability to make 4x the gains, using the money that you do have.

> Take this example – you have $100 and borrow $50 to buy $150 of a stock. If the stock rises 10% ($165), you make $15, or a 15% return on your capital. But, if the stock declines 10% ($135), you lose $15, or a 15% loss. More importantly, if the stock goes up by 50% ($225), you make 75% return. But, if the stock declines 50% (\$75), you lose all your money!

### Looking for a suitable company

- Read the company's _annual report_, _Standard & Poor's Stock Report_ (See S&P500), and WSJ.
- _Earnings_, _earnings growth_, and _return on equity (ROE)_ should be 10% higher than the year before.
- _Sales_ and _Equity_ (if present) should be higher than the year before.
- _Debt_ should be less than half of the company's _assets_.
- The stock's _price-to-earnings ratio_ should be between 20 and 40. [Generally speaking, having a high P/E ratio means that investors like you and believe that you have a bright future](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/05/the-new-fast-food/), but [too high of a P/E ratio means that the stock is overvalued.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/092200.asp)
  - [Different industries have different acceptable P/E ratios.](https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/stock-lower-pe-always-better-choice/) when comparing P/E ratios, only do so for companies in the same industry.
- The stock's _price-to-sales ratio_ should be close to 1.
- Avoid stocks you find on the news (for they become unstable), "the next big thing" companies, and companies that diversify through acquisition instead of innovation.
- Avoid companies that go on the stock exchange through "direct listing". In direct listing, the company generates 0 new shares, i.e. not offering anything. Existing investors hold all the shares. Therefore, the purpose of the listing is just to give the existing investors a way to sell their shares. If they truly want to build a better company, why would they do that?

[You should also like what the company does](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/5rsnr5/what_is_the_most_important_research_before_buying/dd9v416/):

- Sales growth of at least 10% over the past year.
- Low debt
- High quality management with a good track record and unquestionable integrity
- Leading market position or a dominant player in a niche market
- Positive operating cash flow
- High insider ownership
- Competitive advantage of some sort, something that prevents or makes it hard for competition to enter

### Looking for a generic trade

- Buy bonds when stocks are falling. (More research required)
- Consider things that people *need* when stocks are falling. Examples: waste management, education, essential medicine manufacturing, cigarettes, and discount retailers.

### Looking for a suitable time

> If you're looking at this and wondering when to get in, to bargain hunt essentially, and you're asking yourself questions like "today? next week?", you need to step back and think again. Some points to consider:
> - If your time horizon is 10+ years out probably none of this matters
> - If your time horizon is less than 5 years out, you should really question if you should be in the stock market at all
> - Be familiar with the term "dead cat bounce". This is a temporary period of recovery followed by a steeper drop. You're going to see this kind of thing.
> - Large market drops often lead to or are because of a likely recession. This can go on for months or years.
> - After the GFC the markets went down and then sideways for over a year. You essentially missed nothing by waiting two years. This could easily happen again.
> - Learn what "reversion to mean" means. It means that at times the markets generally follow a long term upward trend. At times the market will go above or below that. This can be a useful indicator of whether equities are cheap or expensive. In a given cycle you have boom (above the mean when equities are overbought) to bust (an overcorrection to below the mean when equities are oversold).
> Bear markets are paved with the blood of optimists.  - [cletus](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22527631)

- [Buy the rumour sell the news](http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/2010/buy-on-the-rumor-sell-on-the-news-vod-vz-t-aapl-goog0706.aspx): traders typically dump shares immediately after a new product is introduced. You should therefore buy the shares somewhere around two weeks after the release, and sell a week before the hype cycle comes to a close.
- Don't try to "time the market" (predicting its movements and buying and selling accordingly). You may get lucky, but will not succeed over the long term. [Investing consistently results in you buying both the top and the dip](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/), evening out the worst of crashes.
- When [bonds are doing well](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/there-s-good-economic-news-on-the-horizon-and-that-s-rattling-markets-wait-what-1.5929855), stocks tend to do not so well. Then again, it will probably not drop by much... just corrections.
- If a company dilutes the stock pool with more stocks, the price should go down, and so should other metrics (P/E, P/B, whatever) that go with it.
- Don't day trade. [Almost all gains in the S&P 500 since 1993 had occurred outside regular hours](https://www.ccn.com/the-stock-markets-biggest-gains-always-happen-at-the-same-time-each-day/). This also applies to NASDAQ, TSX, French CAC, DAX, and Nikkei 225.

#### To buy

You can get as technical (with charts and graphs and trend indicators) as you want, but you will never beat the fundamentals. **Do not time the market.**

- [If your time horizon is 10+ years out](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22527631), timing doesn't matter.
- Johnson says that if you miss the top 10 days of equity market growth in a year you miss 90 percent of returns.
- [When VIX is low its time to go; When VIX is high its time to buy](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/3dqggo/when_vix_is_low_its_time_to_go_when_vix_is_high)
- [Relative Strength Index, RSI](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) should be under 50. 100 means the stock is extremely overbought. 0 means the stock is extremely [oversold](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oversold.asp). See [stockcharts.com](http://stockcharts.com/freecharts/) for visuals. Be careful with the index, as modifying its calculation period can switch the results completely. "Oversold" may also just mean the stock is doing very poorly, instead of a bargain indicator.
- [Stochastic Oscillator](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:stochastic_oscillator_fast_slow_and_full) is like RSI, except it comes in three versions: %K (fast), %D (3-day moving average), and full (X-day moving average).
- "The best way to use RSI is to watch and wait for it to enter a zone and then for the %K to cross the %D in the opposite direction. That tends to be a signal that the stock is going to reverse its trend and is a great time to buy or sell."
- The stock's [beta](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) should be less than 1 (i.e. less volatile than the market). a Beta of 0.6 means the thing is 40% less volatile than the market. "Many utilities stocks have a beta of less than 1." "Negative betas are possible for investments that tend to go down when the market goes up."
- "Buy low sell high" is great, but [do not let world events affect your investing decisions](http://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/03/warren-buffetts-5-key-investing-donts.html). During e.g. a war, stocks continue to go up. It is more worthwhile to hold onto securities (assets) than cash.
- In August. "October is known for bringing the highest shifts in volatility for a couple of reasons: third-quarter earnings season kicks off early October, and trading volume is significantly higher after the calm summer months." [Coca-cola](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO/) is almost cyclical in that you would have never lost money if you buy in August and sell in January.
- A "buy" [limit order](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) can be used to trigger a buy when a stock dips below a certain price.
- Inflation favours banks (somehow). So, buy bank stocks when [the idiot](https://forwardprogressives.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/trump-idiot-1.jpg) does anything that encourages inflation.
- You can buy before or after the [ex-dividend date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ex-dividend.asp) (after which the shares will drop in price, because they won't be paid dividends). You just need to know that. If you buy before the date, you should pay no more than the value of the stock % dividend percentage.
- If you are looking to "bargain buy" after a market crash: the bigger the crash, the longer it takes for market sentiment to recover. A small correction can recover within days. A large correction can plateau for a whole year.
- If you are day trading, which I already told you not to do, then you can look at the [bid-ask volumes](https://www.thebalance.com/buying-and-selling-volume-1031027) right before you trade. An increasing number of asks (sells) means the price will go down.
- There is something called a [cash-covered put](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/know-about-cash-covered-puts): "Have you ever entered a limit order to buy a stock below its current trading price, only to find yourself waiting around for the price to drop for your order to execute? ... With a cash-covered put, ... you can collect money (the premium) from the option buyer. The buyer pays this premium for the right to sell you shares of stock, any time before expiration, at the strike price. The premium you receive allows you to lower your overall purchase price if you get assigned the shares. ... But what happens if you are not assigned the shares on or before expiration? You keep the premium."
- On a somewhat related note, a [naked call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedcall.asp) is called a naked call because it is an *uncovered* call.
- There is a overvalued/undervalued indicator for stocks in general: [Market Cap to GDP ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapgdp.asp). [If total market cap was $20 trillion and GDP was the same, stocks would be considered fairly valued (eg; $20 trillion / $20 trillion = 1 {ie; 100%}).](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2020/08/18/us-stock-market-hits-record-77-overvalued/amp/) This indicator is affected by the fact that the stock market is not the economy, so there can be some disconnect between the two.
- When a company announces a n-for-1 stock split (i.e. you get n new stocks for each 1 stock you had), *buy* for three reasons: it usually means the stock price is going up, there will always be [idiots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ifju39/robinhood_really_keeping_it_simple_for_us_retards/) who think they will get n new stocks *at the same price* and buy in, AND because [a different group of idiots](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ijzxrp/tesla_opens_up_at_440_post_split_and_soars_12_to/g3h6l31/) think the stock, which was at say $2000, is now "on sale" for $400. Historically, forward stock splits like that typically results in a brief rise in price, and then a subsequent drop.
- On [borrowing money to buy stocks](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/633fhe/buying_high_dividend_yield_stocks_on_margin_smart/dfr95iw/): "The problem is that you're going to increase your exposure to risk while increasing your returns less than proportionally. ... In the long run, this effect is fairly dramatic, and the leverage will cost more than you think." In other words, if you borrow at 5% interest, you better know for sure your *minimum gain* is 5%. Which you can't say for anything.
- **Speculating**: buying a company's stocks when the company isn't making a profit.
- Look at a company's political climate in addition to what the company's competition is doing.

#### [To sell](http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0412/5-tips-on-when-to-sell-your-stock.aspx)

(Also called 套現, or "cash out")

- When the price is right (hits your target). [Do not be greedy.](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/learn-loss.asp)
- When the price is too low (where you lose too much). If you are trading with a non-registered account (read: neither TFSA nor RRSP), look into [tax loss harvesting](https://youngandthrifty.ca/tax-loss-harvesting-benefits/) (swapping funds with funds of another kind during a loss, and the loss becomes tax credit). [See also](https://www.rbcgam.com/en/ca/learn-plan/investment-basics/turning-losses-into-tax-advantages/detail)
- When the company is no longer doing its business the right way or making enough sales
- When a better stock exists
- When the company is acquired
- When the company goes bankrupt (selling it doesn't give you money, but you can claim it as capital loss)
- [When you anticipate a market failure](http://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/53znlq/_/).
- [Wen your entire portfolio is at risk](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2020/03/05/buy-hold-or-sell-whats-the-right-response-to-current-fears/) and need liquid cash.
- A "sell" [limit order](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp) can be used to trigger a sell when a stock goes above a certain price.
- [In May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sell_in_May)
- When it is November/December, and the price [went down during the year](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7b4x2z/end_of_year_selloff/). This can be claimed as investment loss... but [only if you sell it within the deadline](https://www.tsinetwork.ca/daily-advice/how-to-invest/capital-gains-in-canada-what-is-tax-loss-selling-2/). (Similarly, because you know people will sell for tax credits, it is not wise to buy stocks in November/December, since they are likely to go down as people sell.)
- ~~In 2019. 2020 is when the last of baby boomers reach the age of 60.~~ (But they don't just sell everything at once, so ignore me.)
- When 10 years is up. That is enough time to guarantee a typical stock to have gone up.
- Never, because you're holding and collecting dividends. [Investing for capital gains (i.e. buy low sell high) is really hard... collecting dividends is so much simpler.](https://doorinvestor.com/tips/rich-dads-financial-lessons-from-a-cow/) Note that [buying high-dividend stocks is usually a tradeoff between growth and stability](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/gcr7bi/-/fpdc2da), so you might want to hold off on these until you are near retirement.
- [Never put yourself in a position where you _need to sell at a certain time_](https://www.thebalance.com/risks-when-selecting-equity-investments-356429). By doing so, you lose the "good stocks trend up after a long enough wait" advantage. "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient." - Warren Buffett
- When the insiders are selling (a lot). Insider stock selling is almost never a good sign. Unless they are retiring or something, why would someone with a good company sell?
- Sell if stocks aren't appreciating (rising in value). They do nothing even if you hold on to them for a long time.
- When there is a bubble. Warren Buffett, who famously lost 70% value in airline stocks, uses the [(Wilshire 5000...) Market cap / GDP index](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=qLC). Traditionally, there have always been something wrong whenever people haphazardly started putting money into stocks, but since the government can buy stocks, this index is not as reliable as you may think.

| Diversified (funds of stocks, funds of funds, funds of bonds... funds for anything)                                                                                    | High MER     |

If you want to [leave stock-picking to someone else](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-when-mutual-funds-make-more-sense-than-etfs/), then pick an actively-managed mutual fund, contribute to it monthly, and forget about it.

- There are also bond mutual funds, where the underlying assets are bonds. They are good for [when you anticipate interest rates to drop, but not when you anticipate rates to rise](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedincome.asp). If interest rates rise quicker than your bond's return, you simply lose money... and if inflation happens in the meantime, you also lose money. Note that lower interest rates cause inflation. Which means if you invest in bonds, it is possible that you will be fucked either way.
- [Rebalancing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rebalancing.asp) your portfolio means, if your funds 1 (33%), 2 (33%), and 3 (33%) grew by (-50%, 0%, 50%), then your portfolio is no longer 1/3 each, and you need to "rebalance" your portfolio such that they are 33% each. If you decide to do so by [selling fund 3 rather than putting more money into fund 1](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-and-when-you-should-rebalance-your-portfolio.aspx), _rebalancing implies selling high and buying low._
- /u/learner1314: [Never pump in money into a mutual fund that has invested more than 95% of its money. Instead look at those who have sat on the sidelines and are cash rich with 20-30% of money sitting idle.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/5w41k3/warrens_letter/) I believe the reasoning is that funds with some cash leeway can easily overcome a short term market downturn without having to sell existing positions.
- As much as funds protect against volatility in an individual stock, [they can also hide a lot of low-quality stocks and be repackaged as a high-quality fund, like a CDO](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-04/michael-burry-explains-why-index-funds-are-like-subprime-cdos). This is particularly dangerous for actively-managed funds. Check a fund's underlying assets before buying.

## ETFs (Exchange-traded funds)

| Pros                                                                                | Cons                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Diversified (funds of stocks, funds of funds, funds of bonds... funds for anything) | Every trade costs something |
| Low MER                                                                             |                             |
| Real-time price updates                                                             |                             |

For [non-actively managed funds](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/exchangetradedfunds/08/etf-mutual-fund-difference.asp) (e.g. index funds), mutual funds' high MER don't justify themselves. Either get a low-fee mutual fund or an ETF.

They can be bought and sold whenever the exchange is open, instead of a once-per-night type thing. When you decide to buy/sell, though, do have a bid-ask spread.

ETFs can be traded even when the assets' exchanges are closed. Try not to trade on a holiday where the underlying assets' markets are traded. Don't trade an American ETF on the fourth of July, for example. Sometimes you cannot avoid it (there are plenty of markets that are completely closed when the Dow is open).

[Leveraged ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveraged-etf.asp), which uses derivatives and debt to achieve a multiple gain, [are known for their natural decay. On the long term, holding a position in an N-times leveraged ETF is generally worse than holding an N-times leveraged position in the underlying asset.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/1864191-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-decay-of-leveraged-etfs) As /u/MasterCookSwag tried to put it simply: "You have $100 invested in dogshit and another $100 in 3x dogshit. Dogshit goes from $100 to $90 back to $100. That's a loss of 10% then a subsequent gain of 11.11% for a net 0% move. 3x dogshit does, you guessed it, 3x that which means it loses 30% and subsequently gains 33.33%. That's a drop from $100 to $70 then back up to $93. You just lost 7% because of leverage. Voila. [You lost money because of resetting leverage.](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-a-leveraged-etf-decay-risk-volatility.html)"

* "CAD-hedged" ETFs protects you from foreign exchange fluctuation. It is *not* good for when you want exposure to another currency (i.e. hedging).

## Property

Properties (e.g. houses that you don't live in) usually beat inflation in the long term.

|                           | Gold is rarely "consumed"; supply increases over time                                                                                                                                |

* [Gold prices are heavily influenced by monetary and fiscal policies](https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/13/7-common-factors-that-influence-gold-prices.aspx): if the fed lowers interest rates and/or triggers QE, then both low bond yields and high inflation will drive up the price of gold.
* Buy gold when the market is stable. Since gold has inherent value, gold is often bought by others when the market is unstable, which is the time you should sell. As well, gold will be sold if people need to take out their savings to cover their massive losses during a downturn.
* Gold is not the only precious metal; silver is also commonly traded. However, its broader use in manufacturing leads to less predictable pricing, and effectiveness as a store of value.

## Bitcoin

| Pros                      | Cons                                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Great for diversification | ...assuming people value Bitcoin as a store of value    |
| Supply is fixed           | Negatively affected by high bond yield or interest rate |
|                           | Does not generate income                                |

Never treat Bitcoin as an investment. You can gamble all you want, but it is not an investment.

- "The fact that 90% of people use (Bitcoin) for speculation rather than as currency is all the proof you need that it's a bubble."

## Allocating

["RRSP is tax-deferred and funded with pre-tax money, TFSA is tax-sheltered and funded with after-tax money."](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/7d54sa/should_i_prioritize_certain_etfs_in_tfsa_vs_rrsp/dpvn3pd/) - Redditor explaining how you're fucked either way, just when.

- [Put high-risk, high-reward assets in the TFSA, and low-risk, low-reward assets in the RRSP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/a5th6k/investments_in_rrsp_vs_tfsa/)
- If [30 year olds should have 100% in equities and 60 year olds should have 50/50 mix of equities and fixed-income investments](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/at-30-or-60-how-best-to-invest-your-tfsa/article36450229/), then you can tell each year you go beyond 30, you rebalance ~1.4% of your portfolio.
- [US dividend ETFs prefer to be put in an RRSP](https://www.fool.ca/2016/12/13/not-all-canadian-dividend-etfs-are-created-equal/) because they don't have dividend tax credit either way, I think.
- Since [DRIP changes the adjusted cost base of your holdings](https://www.moneysense.ca/columns/ask-moneysense/key-things-to-know-about-reinvested-dividends-on-your-etfs/) and you need to take care of the calculations, it is best to ignore the DRIP option and reinvest the dividends yourself if you have a non-registered account.
