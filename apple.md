- To edit widgets in the notification center, [kill Notification Center from Activity Monitor](https://old.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/kucne3/til_you_can_change_which_4_cities_are_displayed/)--I shit you not--and then you'll be able to do it.
- [Minimize minimizes a single window. Hide hides the entire application.](https://superuser.com/questions/51773/mac-os-minimize-vs-hide-whats-the-difference#comment53494_51775) Unless you are on whatever drug AltTab is on, in which case the two are identical.
- `brew` installs CLI applications. [`brew cask` installs graphical applications](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/125471).
- To see which executable is listening to a specific port: [`sudo lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | grep :$PORT`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4421674/1558430)
- PgUp / PgDn doesn't move your caret, for some reason. You need Option + PgUp/PgDn for that.
- Macbook keyboards don't have: home, end, page up, page down, and sometimes not even physical F-keys. If you think Cmd+up/down/left/right are good enough, I am so sorry.
- `/usr/local/bin` is often a writable directory on a mac because [homebrew modifies that during setup](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/192227/how-to-make-files-in-usr-local-writable-for-homebrew).
- To delete words in Mac's version of bash, you need to [enable "Use option key as meta key" in one of the terminal profiles](https://stackoverflow.com/a/327676/1558430) before it lets you.
- Want to turn off your macbook's display and use just your external monitors? [Can't](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/269853/turn-off-the-macbook-main-display-while-working-with-monitor). You need to close the lid and lose access to the power button.
- ["Unlike most UNIX-based operating systems, OS X does not use a preallocated disk partition for the backing store. Instead, it uses all of the available space on the machineâ€™s boot partition."](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/AboutMemory.html) [You run out of swap space when your disk is full](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7417584?answerId=7417584021#7417584021).
- [Windows is designed by people who use macOS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30055568).
- [DON'T. BUY. AN APPLE PRODUCT. IF YOU NEED IT FIXED.](https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s1s5ij/the_macbook_air_has_blown_me_away/hsaowa2/)
- Apple's first-party apps are only updated via system upgrades. Therefore, despite Android's typical support period of 2 to 3 years, their first-party apps often updated for longer than those in iOS.
- The AirPods case (without AirPods in it) costs [$100](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MR8U2AM/A/wireless-charging-case-for-airpods).
- [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft_Office) started off exclusives for the Mac. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates worked closely on it. Windows was conceived because, get this, when Bill Gates recommended to Steve Jobs that licensing the Mac's OS would be a good idea, Steve Jobs said no. [So he made his own](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-bill-gates-steve-jobs-feud-frenemies-2016-3).
- Steve Jobs considered the iPad ["the most important thing he's ever done"](https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/01/26/steve_jobs_apple_tablet_the_most_importing_thing_ive_ever_done), not the iPhone. iPad was designed before the iPhone, but the iPhone project took priority.
- File names in MacOS are apparently case-insensitive.
- [Java is not supported on Apple devices](https://alvinalexander.com/mac-os-x/apple-mac-java-deprecated-os-x-sdk-jvm/). Think: iOS apps, [Mac apps](https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2021/01/the-transition-to-apple-silicon/).
- The lightning port is better than USB-C because [lightning is more durable](https://www.cnet.com/news/stop-buying-apples-flimsy-lightning-cables-try-these-instead/), [iPhones don't need to charge fast](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208137), USB-C doesn't use all the [pins](https://ioshacker.com/iphone/why-the-fourth-pin-on-your-lightning-cable-turns-black), and [iPhones don't need high transfer rates](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-11-pro-max-shows-usb-transfer-speed-only-480-mb-s.2202686/)... [so they say](https://www.appledystopia.com/reviews/usb-c-vs-lightning-page-1/). "Lightning is the right tool for the job," they say. "Apple is not going to replace Lightning ports with USB-C on the iPhone and iPad," they say.
- Compared to iPhones, iPod touches do not have: brightness sensor, fingerprint reader, vibration motor, GPS, and (obviously) phone functionality. They still have a headphone jack and flashlight though.
- Apple practices the Pareto (80-20) Principle. 20% of their customers contribute to 80% of the industry's profits. So they make the good stuff for rich people (but fuck up every so often but that's ok). Apple Maps frequently updates in rich countries. Google gets sued for [anti-competition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antitrust.asp) for being the 80%. Basically, if you want to be rich, go after the rich people.
- iPods had official socks. Like cases but they ["keep your iPod warm on cold days"](https://youtu.be/WGinG6rHSrw?t=254).
- Since Apple users are used to having their decisions made for them, and, therefore, not making decisions, they are possibly easier to be around with than Android users, who tend to want things *their* way.
- Mac OS X kept getting minor updates only because Steve Jobs once said "Mac OSX has set Apple up for the next 20 years"... so they did that by releasing 10.1, 10.2, ... up to 10.15.
- The inspiration for iOS "slide to unlock" came from the airplane toilet door lock.
- ADB can also stand for [Apple Desktop Bus](https://eggfreckles.net/2013/12/27/adb-the-epitome-of-early-apple/), some kind of IO bus for 1980s peripherals.
- The famous "grass" wallpaper that came with Mac OS X was shot by Steve Jobs.
- The original ORIGINAL iPhone (the one Steve Jobs demoed on stage) had a plastic screen. He later changed his mind before the device was released to general public.
- The lifetime ownership cost of an Apple mobile device (read: iPhone) might be [cheaper than Android](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/f2djw5/samsung_galaxy_s20_megathread/fhc3xnp/) if a device is guaranteed to be supported for five years instead of just one or two.
- [Both Android and iOS claim to be useful tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ew6nqj/i_miss_android_a_few_thoughts_from_a_recent/). Android requires frequent sharpening by the owner, and while iOS comes sharp, it cannot be sharpened.
- Steve Jobs oversaw the design of the iPhone 4. [He insisted the body be built in stainless steel because it becomes beautiful as it wears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=788E-ATJ3pk). He dies just as the 4S was released. Apple switched back to aluminium for the iPhone 5.
- All iPhones are (supposed to be, anyway) announced at 9:41am, the time the first iPhone was announced, with [all their screens and screenshots showing 9:41](https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/14/why-9-41-am-is-the-always-the-time-displayed-on-iphones-and-ipad/), because... Steve Jobs said so.
- [Apple launched a clothing line.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14x5n_oNEV4) They also had one of the first a digital cameras, a home phone with screen, and a gaming console. They refuse to service devices from people who smoke. The metallic dials on iOS 6 that reflect light depending on the angle on which the phone is held.
- [Apple dropping the "i" in product names](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca2HXEl6krI) happened when Steve Jobs was still alive. He demoed "Apple TV", not the "iTV" as fans expected, because Apple doesn't own the letter "i", and it is hard to patent iNames.
- The "i" in iProducts does not stand for internet all the time. iLife, iPhoto, iDVD, and iMovie have nothing to do with the internet.
- Contrary to everything you saw on TV, [the iPhone X display is not folded](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-OLED-display-in-iPhone-X-folded-at-the-bottom).
- To [install an IPA over the air (OTA)](https://docs.monaca.io/en/products_guide/monaca_ide/deploy/non_market_deploy/), you need a custom-crafted `.plist` file, served over HTTPS, that tells the OS where to get the IPA. Having that `plist` file is not enough; it also needs to be served through a link like `itms-services://?action=download-manifest&url=(that actual url of the plist file)`, because... I don't know.
- ["Ad hoc" provisioning profiles and "app store" provisioning profiles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8354121/what-is-the-difference-between-ad-hoc-distribution-and-app-store-distribution-in) are both "distribution" profiles, while "app development" provisioning profiles are not distribution profiles. A distribution profile contains exactly one certificate: the certificate that signed the app. That way, a provisioning profile is only authorised to provision ('privately disitribute') apps that are signed by the same certificate.
- The P in ["plist"](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/AboutInformationPropertyListFiles.html) stands for Property.
- iPad OS treats mice as an assistive touch accessory. Since its job is to emulate a finger, it does not handle scrolling or right clicking.
- Siri came _before_ Google Assistant.
- [Lenovo's daughter had a MacBook, iPad, and iPhone when she was arrested.](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/3/22/18278086/huawei-meng-wanzhou-had-a-macbook-iphone-and-ipad-when-she-was-arrested)
- Your iOS app needs to be approved for _beta testing_.
- Apple's devices were once named in (incremental update, big update) ways because [AT&T had two-year contracts](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/12/17/were-keeping-smartphones-longer-and-its-going-to-make-them-crazy-expensive/), so naming those devices like they were major upgrades every two years worked out for both of them.
- The guy who invented THX, which stands for [Tomlinson Holman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomlinson_Holman) something, went on to work at Apple. Apple's audio quality has been pretty good.
- [Phil Schiller's grand philosophical theory](http://fortune.com/2015/12/04/schiller-apple-theory/) is, essentially: the job of whichever Apple product that you have closest to you should do more and more things so you don't need to reach for the next closest Apple product so often. In the current case, the Apple Watch does more so you don't need the iPhone so much so you don't need the iPad so much so you don't need the Macbook so much so you don't need the Mac so much. And for the Mac, its job is to challenge what we can do with computers.
- The iOS launcher is called the [SpringBoard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpringBoard).
- In the case of product red, since RED is superscripted and also what's trademarked, the actual logo is `(PRODUCT)^(RED^(TM))`, where TM is superscripted twice.
- So many people use iPhones, that when iOS 7 came out, [its parallax wallpapers caused enough people to get motion sickness to make the news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_7).
- Macbook Pro fans don't spin up until [the CPU is 81 degrees C.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgeh7ZJRhZU)
- Animojis work even if the depth sensor is covered. That means the iPhone X isn't even using its unique hardware. That means every iPhone could have gotten this feature. But no, that's not the point. This feature lets your friends know you have an iPhone X.
- The HomePod exists mainly to keep people who would otherwise buy the Google Home to stay away from Google's ecosystem.
- [iOS 1 never allowed more than one page of apps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gxa2rq-kL8) It never had an app store so it wasn't a problem.
- The original iPhone has a recessed headphone jack that allows only Apple-style headphones (the ones with straight jacks that look like a dog dildo) to be plugged in.
- [iPhone home buttons are digitally signed and paired with the phone that came with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAzfZ0lQJO0). Put it in another iPhone and it will stop working.
- Apple Park, [a giant donut of doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park#/media/File:Aerial_view_of_Apple_Park_dllu.jpg), replaced 1 Infinite Loop as the headquarters in 2017. The two campuses are just 3km away.
- [The iPhone 8 Plus has the longest lasting battery (out of all tested flagships)](https://www.phonearena.com/news/Our-iPhone-8-Plus-battery-life-test-reveals-the-best-endurance-from-an-iPhone-yet_id98512), at twice as long of a runtime than your phone, and happens to take twice as long to charge.
- [There were no CPU touch boost drivers in iOS](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12873/apple-announces-ios-12) until version 12.
- XCode can give you a bullshit [`-1=ffffffffffffffff`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44173831/codesign-returned-unknown-error-1-ffffffffffffffff) error just because you didn't unlock your keychain.
- To clear all your notifications at once, [rage-press the "x"](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-click-wonder-how-to-clear-many-days-of-notifications-on-your-iphone-in-one-tap/) and you will be given the option.
- To sort your home screen icons alphabetically, [select your icons in reverse alphabetical order](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-quickly-rearrange-your-home-screen-in-ios-11/), with multiple fingers, and then release. This is the only way.
- On an iPhone, the mute toggle showing red means "mute is on", not "sound is on".
- Four counts of other manufacturers copying Apple for absolutely no reason whatsoever: headphone jack removal, notch, "AR emojis", [swipe nav gestures](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/05/09/android-ps-gesture-navigation-bad-google/). All occurred in the 2015-2018 range, all half-baked, all worse, with no reasonable person claiming to enjoy any of these things. If Apple were to turn the iPhone into the shape of a dildo, there is a 100% likelihood that at least one other manufacturer will follow.
- The iPad doesn't have a calculator because [Steve Jobs said no, pull it we can't ship that (stretched-out calculator UI)](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/4dlqgv/why_does_ipad_not_have_a_native_calculator/d1s5rr9/).
- [Apple's vision is to eliminate technology from the user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO0b-l-u7Yk), not to make the best technology for the user. If it means to remove ports (because you need ports only if you think the tech exists), then it _will_ remove ports. If making things lighter makes the tech less obvious, then it _will_ make products lighter. Apple also believes that customers don't know what they want. Customers asking for a faster horse actually want a car. No customer will ask for the next big thing.
- The original iPhone had no screws holding the body together. The [pentalobe atrocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentalobe_security_screw) was committed first in 2009, on a macbook.
- [Apple doesn't tweet.](https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/3/12781498/apple-twitter-account-paid-tweets) Even if they tweet, they delete the tweets afterwards.
- Apple originally wanted to use a full apple. But in small print it looked like a cherry. So they added the bite.
- While you [can](https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-hot-code-push/wiki/App-Store-FAQ) update your hybrid iOS app remotely and bypassing the app store review process, you cannot ask the user if they want to update.
- The iPhone 8's resolution is around 720p.
- iOS apps are [`.ipa`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ipa) compressed (payload), and `.app` uncompressed.
- `xcode-select --print-path` gives you where Xcode is installed.
- `xcodebuild -list -project ???.xcodeproj` tells you what the Xcode project is configured to build, and information like targets and schemes.
- Adding `build` after that command, i.e. `xcodebuild -project ???.xcodeproj build`, builds the `.app`.
- "Archive" means "Compile", and "Compile" means something else, and "Build" means neither of the three.
- iOS app submission requires one screenshot for each screen size your app claims to support.
- [You cannot install IPAs on the simulator](https://stackoverflow.com/a/517541/1558430) (if it is built for a different CPU architecture).
- [Why would you pay for a phone made by Google? "You paid for a phone so Google can sell you to advertisers."](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianmorris/2017/02/10/how-google-blew-it-with-the-pixel-and-pixel-xl/#3a1ca730f3f6) This is not the case for Apple.
- Force touch is more basic; [3D touch](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/what-is-the-difference-between-apple-iphone-3d-touch-and-force-touch/) is more granular. [It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Touch#3D_Touch) would appear that iPhones have 3D touch, and all other "trackpad devices" have force touch.
- According to EverythingApplePro, [Apple releases things on Tuesdays and starts preorders on Fridays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=norgCJzrNb4).
- The Apple A10X chip is the first TSMC 10nm chip to be used by a consumer device.
- "Mercury" is the Firefox for iOS.
- There is normally no way to [transfer a file using Bluetooth](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18884705/transfer-data-between-ios-and-android-via-bluetooth) on iOS. Get a Mac.
- Chrome for iOS makes requests to `http://localhost:0` for [URL verification][newrelic].
- "A [provisioning profile](https://pewpewthespells.com/blog/migrating_code_signing.html#introduction-to-code-signing) is a plist file that is cryptographically signed by Apple's CA to ensure it cannot be modified after being created. This allows Apple to have complete control over the deployment mechanism that is used on iOS."
- [WKWebView](http://blog.initlabs.com/post/100113463211/wkwebview-vs-uiwebview) uses less CPU for WebGL-related tasks on iOS.
- The iPhone 6s is 0.3mm thicker than the iPhone 6 (for the force touch rubbish). Their casings are not interchangeable.
- Depending on your device, Tim decided it would be nice if you get totally different UI on it, depending on which one it is. Swiping up on the iPhone gets you the control center, and on the iPad, it is a dock instead.
- "iPhone X is top notch lol"
- The new Siri knows its birthday (around 2011) but won't answer how old it is. Therefore, Siri is a woman.
- The iOS source code contained "vim turds" [at some point](https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/commit/0a798f6738bc1db01281fc08ae024145e84df927#diff-a084b794bc0759e7a6b77810e01874f2L6).
- "2007: home button always takes you home, no matter where you are (mentioned in keynote). 2017: home button takes you home most of the time if you press it once. Press it twice and you get an app switcher. Press it three times for accessibility. If your phone is locked, press it once to wake, twice to bring up passcode. If you're in a notification, press once to get rid of notification, then again to go home. Rest finger to unlock without opening home. Double rest to bring reachability. Press and hold for Siri. Press and hold longer for Siri with stop on release." - /u/atalkingfish
- CarrotPop makes an iPhone app, called ["Send Me to Heaven"](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/send-me-to-heaven-throw-phone-apple_n_3720888), that scores how high you throw the phone into the air. The app was banned.
- The Safari responsive design mode straight out [denies other ecosystems exist](http://imgur.com/TYfG7DN).
- When you take an elevator ride with Steve Jobs and tell him what you do, results may vary. You either [get fired](https://www.quora.com/Who-did-Steve-Jobs-actually-fire-in-an-elevator), or [you don't](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/6wsmub/did_steve_jobs_make_much_smalltalk_with_his/) ("That's what I heard. I hope it gets better.") It depends on what you say (said).
- Siri's voice actress is [Susan Bennett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2bTymnb1uE), and she's lovely.
- The Kinect/iPhone X use randomised dots for depth recognition, rather than a grid. "If you use a regular repetitive grid you will have a periodicity in the observed pattern, if an observed object moves closer to the camera the reflected laser shifts further to the side until it would overlap with a different point at a different depth in the 2D image." (which is bad)
- iPad and iPad Pro have different "air gap" sizes (thickness between glass and display).
- Multi-column "tree-style" lists, like the ones you find in the Mac Finder, are called [Miller columns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns), reportedly invented by a Mark Miller.
